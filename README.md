# **Website Replica - Dalhousie University**
This project is a replica of a single page from the official website of Dalhousie University. It has been built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skills in front-end web development and showcase the ability to replicate the design and functionality of an existing website.


## **Project Structure**
The project structure is organized as follows:
`├── index.html`

`├── css`

`│   └── main.css`

`│   └── normalize.css`

`├── js`

`│   └── script.js`

`└── img`

    `└── dalfcs.jpg`

    
**index.html**: This is the main HTML file that represents the webpage structure and content.
**css/styles.css**: This CSS file contains the styles and layout for the webpage.
**css/normalize.css**: This CSS file provides better cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML elements.
**js/script.js**: This JavaScript file contains any interactivity or dynamic functionality for the webpage.
**imag**/: This folder contains all the images used in the webpage.

## Getting Started
To view the website replica locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Usage
Once the webpage is loaded in the browser, you will see a replica of the chosen page from the Dalhousie University website. The website is fully functional and interactive, allowing users to navigate through the page, access various sections, and interact with different elements.

Feel free to explore the page, click on links, interact with buttons, and experience the functionality provided.

## Customization
You can modify the replica according to your needs or add additional features by editing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

To modify the content, update the HTML within the `index.html` file.
To change the styles and layout, modify the CSS in the `css/styles.css` file.
To add interactivity or dynamic functionality, make changes in the `js/script.js` file.
